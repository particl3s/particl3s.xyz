Currently the movie so aptly named Suzume No Tojimari is playing in my whereabouts and I had the fortune to view it in a theatre. To my thoughts it was going to be only a few people, anime weebs with asthma and myself. As it turns out the venue was packed and in hindsight all the better for it. It was funny, heartwarming, depressing and much, much more. If you get a chance to see it on a large screen it gets thumbs up for any anime fan. 9/10
