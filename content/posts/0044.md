My oh my the last month has been busy, a lot less sleep and worthwhile drawing. In the midsts of that ended up having 
a operating system burn out. Not to worry though, it's been replaced. Now it's on a Debian based system 
without any integration issue. My first one actually, rather fascinating moving from an Aur base to something else.
