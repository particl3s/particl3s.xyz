Lord of Dice was a mobile card strategy game, I haven't played it in years but it was brought up in a conversation on the internet. There's hardly any youtube videos about it and the .apk is hard to find. Nor is there enough space on my mobile device to use it. It's sort of in a tie with how much time it takes where it equals Ragnarok Online. Some of my best memories are mmorpgs.
